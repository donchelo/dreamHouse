[INTENDED USE: Professional Architectural Portfolio Image]

TASK:
- Action: Generate a new ${viewType} of the house provided in the reference image.
- Camera Perspective: ${vistaDescription}

CRITICAL COMPOSITION RULE:
- Subject: The building is the SOLE PROTAGONIST.
- Background: Must be completely neutral (open sky, landscape, or vegetation).
- Exclude: NEVER include neighboring buildings, adjacent houses, other structures, visible neighbors, party walls, or competing architecture. The subject must stand completely alone.

ARCHITECTURAL STYLE & CONSISTENCY:
- Constraint: The building must be IDENTICAL in form, materials, and character to the reference image. Same house, different camera angle. All massing, openings, roof geometry, and material palettes are fixed.
- Style Context: Replicate the design language ${styles} ${architectCredit ? `by ${params.architect.join(' & ')}` : ""}.
- Materials: ${materialList}. Rendered with honest texture, grain patterns, and natural color variation.

PHOTOGRAPHY & LIGHTING:
- Camera Setting: Shot on ${params.cameraPreset}, ${params.focalLength} lens at ${params.aperture}, ${params.filmSimulation}
- Lighting: ${lightingCtx}
- Mood/Atmosphere: ${params.mood || "Professional, high-end architectural photography — evocative but not over-processed."}
- Look: Photorealistic. Real textures, pores, material thickness, glass reflections, and soft shadows. No digital smoothness.

ARCHITECTURAL PORTFOLIO GENERATION:
Task: Generate a new ${viewType} of the house provided in the reference image.

CRITICAL COMPOSITION RULE: The building is the SOLE PROTAGONIST. The background must be neutral — open sky, landscape, or vegetation. NEVER include neighboring buildings, adjacent houses, other structures, or visible neighbors. No urban density, no party walls. The subject must stand completely alone.

VISUAL REQUIREMENTS:
- View Type: ${vistaDescription}
- Style Consistency: The building must be IDENTICAL in form, materials, and character to the reference — same house, different camera position. Every architectural decision (massing, openings, roof geometry, material palette) is fixed.
- Context: ${params.environment ? `The house sits within a ${params.environment} setting — keep the environmental character consistent.` : "Maintain the same site and environmental context as the reference."}
- Lighting: ${lightingCtx}.
- Atmosphere: ${params.mood || "Professional, high-end architectural photography — evocative but not over-processed."}

NARRATIVE:
An architectural photograph ${architectCredit}, capturing the ${viewType} of the building ${styles}.
The camera is placed to reveal ${vistaDescription}.
Every material — ${materialList} — must be rendered with honest texture and physical specificity: grain patterns, natural color variation, the micro-imperfections that confirm real construction. Window glass reflects its surroundings. Shadows have soft edges and reveal surface depth. No surface looks digitally smooth or uniformly perfect.
